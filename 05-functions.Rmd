# Functions

- Note that in contrast to Python, R doesn't require an explicit `return` call -- if `return` is not used, the R function will return the output of its last expression. For instance, the following two code snippets 

```{r}
mean_squared_error <- function(x, y){
  mean_diff <- mean(x - y)
  mean_diff^2
}

mean_squared_error(c(1, 2, 3), c(1, 2, 5))
```

and


```{r}
mean_squared_error <- function(x, y){
  mean_diff <- mean(x - y)
  return(mean_diff^2)
}

mean_squared_error(c(1, 2, 3), c(1, 2, 5))
```

both return `0.4444444`

- For your convenience, you can save functions in a separate file and load it into your current R session. E.g., you can save the `mean_squared_error` we created above as a .R file, for example, `mse.R`. Then, you can source the file in your current R session to load the function, a shown in the screenshot below:

# Importing Code

`source()`



# Developing R Packages

- If you are interested in developing your own R packages (also known as "extensions"), have a look at the official guide available at [https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html).
