# R Resources and Help

- Have a look at the official introduction to R, which is freely available at [https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html) -- it is a much more thorough version compared to my series of notes.

# Executing code

- Personally, I prefer using R Studio when working with R (for details, see [01-installing-r.md](01-installing-r.md))
- In R Studio, you can set up a R Markdown document where you can write notes and execute code at the same time -- it's similar to a MS Word document that also allows you to run code; in addition, there is also a console view to execute code in the conventional way:

![](images/02/run-code-rstudio.png)
- One thing to notice about R, coming from Python or other programming languages, is the somewhat unusual assignment operator `<-`. We use the assignment operator to assign an expression (right side of the assignment operator) to a variable (left side of the assignnment operator). For example

```{r}
my_variable <- 3+5
```

- Note that assignments per se don't result in any "visible" outputs. For example, one way to show the result of executing the expression above, `3+5`, you can call the variable that it was assigned to.

```{r}
my_variable
```
- (In computer science contexts, "showing" some result is often called "printing" due to the history of computers -- back in the day, before computer monitors were invented, results had to be printed on paper.)

# Data Types

- Similar to Python, everything in R is an object. If used Python (or Java) before, you may be familiar with that concept. In a broader sense, you can think of an object as an instance of a class. In a sense, a class is a template that allows you to create different objects. You can think of a class as a cookie cutter that can make different cookies (objects).

## Floats (real numbers)

- You may be used to referring to real numbers as floats (which may refer to single-precision or double-precision floats) in other programming languages. Often, double-precision floats are also abbreviated as "doubles."
- In the R community, people also often refer to float (and doubles) as `numeric` data type. Here, `numeric` is the class for creating such numbers. More precisely, by default, R will typically use double-precision real numbers (if you install the 64 bit version of R, which I recommend). In R, when you hear `numeric`, you can think of it as more of an umbrella term for both single- and double-precision floats.
- You can check the data type via the `typeof()` function. Note that by default, numbers are always double-precision floats by default:

```{r}
typeof(1)
class(1)
typeof(1.0)
class(1.0)
```


## Integers

- Note that R, by default, creates real numbers (floats or doubles) when entering a number as explained in the previous section.
- If you want to create an integer, you have to explicitly append the letter L. E.g.,

```{r}
my_int <- 1L
my_int
typeof(my_int)
class(my_int)
```

- By the way, you can use the `as.double()` and `as.integer()` functions to convert between the two respective "numeric" types:

```{r}
my_float <- as.double(my_int)
typeof(my_float)

my_int <- as.integer(my_float)
typeof(my_int)
```

## Boolean

- True and False values 
- `TRUE` & `FALSE`, or `T` and `F`


# Data Structures

## Vectors and Sequences

- Vectors can be created using the `vector()` function. The following will create a vector consisting of 3 double-precision floats:


```{r}
x <- vector(mode = "double", length = 3)
x
```

- As you can see in the code snippet above, the vector contains all 0's (the default values). We can now fill it with our desired values, e.g., 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3, via indexing and assignment as follows:

```{r}
x[1] <- 0.1
x[2] <- 0.2
x[3] <- 0.3
x
```

- More conveniently, we can create vectors containing values using the `c()` function -- think of `c` as short for "concatenate" in this context. The type of the vector is the same type as the type of its elements. For example, to create a vector of 3 real numbers, we could do

```{r}
x <- c(0.1, 0.2, 0.3)
x
typeof(x)
```

- Note that we cannot mix and match objects of different types when creating vectors. What will happen is that the vector will assume a type when mixing different types, which is float or "double" in the case of mixing integers and real numbers:

```{r}
x <- c(1L, 0.2, 0.3, 1L, 10L)
x
typeof(x)
```

- I highly recommend avoiding mixing types in vectors; if you would like to mix different types, please see the section on "lists" below.

- For creating sequence vectors, similar to Python's range, we can use the colon operator as shown below:

```{r}
1:10
```
- Note that in contrast to Python, sequences include the endpoint, though (here: 10; Python would return 1 ... 9).

## Strings / Character Vectors

## Missing Values

- There are two ways to represent missing values in R, NA and NaN
- NaN stands for Not a Number, and it is used when the output of a mathematical representation cannot be represented by the computer.
- NA (I assume it stands for Not Available) is used for other cases where a value is unknown (and it's not a NaN); a typical case where you would use a NA is when you collected measurements but didn't record a measurement in a particular case -- in other words, the result is missing.

- The `is.na()` and `is.nan()` functions allow us to test for missing NA and NaN values, respectively:

```{r}
vector_with_na <- c(NA, 0.1, 0.5)
is.na(vector_with_na)

vector_with_nan <- c(NaN, 0.1, 0.5)
is.nan(vector_with_nan)
```

- Note that an NaN value evaluates to "true" via `is.na()`; however, a NA value does not evaluate to "true" via `is.nan()`:

```{r}
is.na(vector_with_nan)

is.nan(vector_with_na)
```

## Lists

- Similar to Python, lists in R can contain objects from different classes. In other words, lists allow us to mix and match data types (which is not supported in arrays or vectors).

```{r}
x <- list(1.5, 1L, "A")
typeof(x)
x
```

- Note that the double-bracket refers to the list index of that element. For instance, to refer to the 2nd element in the list, we can execute

```{r}
x[2]
```

## One-Indexing

- As seen in the previous section on lists, R's index, unlike other languages such as C or Python, starts as 1 instead of 0.

## NA values

## Matrices

- Matrices in R are a special array class that allows us to create data structures for representing mathematical matrices.

- Similar to using the `vector` function, there is a matrix function that allows us to create an empty matrix. Via the `nrow` and `ncol` parameters, we can specify the dimensions:

```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(nrow = 4, ncol = 3)
my_matrix
class(my_matrix)
```

- Similar to what works with vectors, we can fill the matrix via indexing and assignments

```{r}
my_matrix[1,1]<- 1.1
my_matrix[2,1] <- 2.1
my_matrix[2,2] <- 2.2
my_matrix
```

- You can also create a matrix from a sequence directly, i.e., 

```{r}
my_matrix <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 4, ncol = 3)
my_matrix
```

- Note, if you want to know the number of rows and columns later on, there's a more efficient way than counting them. Calling the `dim` function will print the number of rows and columns:

```{r}
dim(my_matrix)
```

- Interestingly, R matrices are closely tied to R vectors. In fact, you can reshape a vector into a matrix by modifying it's dimension attribute:

```{r}
my_vector <- c(1:12)
my_vector
my_matrix <- my_vector
dim(my_matrix) <- c(4, 3)
my_matrix
```

- Another way for creating matrices is by using the `cind()` function to combine sequences by stacking them as columns, e.g., 

```{r}
my_matrix <- cbind(1:3, 4:6)
my_matrix
```

- There is also a `rbind()` function that does the same thing via rows:

```{r}
my_matrix <- rbind(1:3, 4:6)
my_matrix
```

## Factors

- Factors are a useful feature for representing categorical data in vector form.
- Of course, everything can be handled via integer vectors, but it's a nice convenience feature -- you can think of factors as integer vectors on steroids. That is, integer vectors with the integer vectors replaced by labels. (R, in fact, uses an integer vector under the hood for factor vectors.)

- Suppose we have the following factor vector containing a bunch of movie ratings:

```{r}
x <- factor(c('great', 'good', 'bad', 'ok', 'good', 'good', 'great'))
x
```

- As you can see above, the Levels attribute shows the unique categories.
- Also, there is the handy `table` function for summarizing the counts per category:

```{r}
table(x)
```

- As you may recall from my research talks or other lectures, there are two types of categorical data, nominal (unordered) and ordinal (ordered).
- Models which assume an ordered variable, e.g., ordinal regression models, may require you to specify the order in the factor vector. By default, the unique values in the factor variable are ordered alphabetically.
- Using the `levels` parameter as shown below lets us define the category order, for example, great > good > ok > bad:


```{r}
x <- factor(c('great', 'good', 'bad', 'ok', 'good', 'good', 'great'),
            levels=c('great', 'good', 'ok', 'bad'))
x
table(x)
```

## Data Frames

- Data frames are one of the best and distinguishing features of R when it comes to data analysis.
- You can think of a data frame as a table (similar to a table in a paper, or a table in an Excel file).
- Most data comes in tabular form, which is why data frames are a convenient data container to work with.
- Btw. if you have used Python for scientific computing, you have likely encountered Pandas `DataFrame` objects. In fact, Pandas' data frames were inspired by R.
- Data frames look very similar to matrices, however, matrices are mathematical objects (rank-2 tensors) used in linear algebra
- Also, in contrast to matrices, a data frame allows us to have columns with different types (and it comes with a descriptive row header)
- Overall, you can think of a data frame as a fancy stack of R lists, which comes with a whole set of convenience functions.



```{r}
df <- data.frame(MyIntegerVar = 1:4, MyCharVar = c("A", "B", "A", "B"), MyBoolVar = c(T, F, T, T))
df
```
- In case you are working with very long data frames and want to count the columns and rows, you can use the `nrow` and `ncol` functions:

```{r}
nrow(df)
ncol(df)
```

- Suppose we want to change the row names later; for this, we can use the `names` function and overwrite the data frames `names` attribute:

```{r}
names(df)
names(df) <- c("A", "B", "C")
df
```

- In practice, we usually construct data frames by loading data from a CSV file, for example. More on that in Chapter 03.
